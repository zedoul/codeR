R programming challenges platform.
This project is NOT finished yet.

# Background

At workplaces engineers organise programming challenages
where they hack on interesting data analysis skills.
It is a good way to get that side-project going or validate idea
for a new technique.

# How-To-Use

1. You'll need to have R environment, at least 3.0.0

  ```
  > R --version
  3.3.0
  ```

2. Install coder with devtools

  ```
  devtools::install_github("zedoul/coder")
  ```

3. Run coder

  ```
  library(coder)
  coder()
  ```

# Plan

* R platform in R
* Make domain language in R
* Write Lisp style R code
* Maintain solutions like the similar way as [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs)
* Release alpha version no later than the end of 2017
